Operators are used to perform operatons. The types of operators in php are:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Increament/Decrement Operators
* Logical Operators
* String Operators
* Array Operators
* Conditional Assignment Operators

## Arthmetic Operators
Arthmatic operators are used to perform common arithmetical operations such as addition, subtraction, division.

| Name (Operators) | Discription | Demo |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|
| Addition (+) | Performs Addition | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/KUDduxNFjZaL25wK8Xx7gA) |
| Subtraction (-) | Performs Subtraction | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/pCQG1I0FBIQm6TGN2YwzUg?language=php) |
| Multiplication (*) | Performs Multiplication | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/3FEfkjPkhET86Y0GWHzWUQ?language=php) |
| Division(/) | Performs Division | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/SEqwDwaaC2Hf0YwPzgcRqw?language=php) |
| Modulus (%) | Finds Reminder | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/xbEm0dQ7ykfo5dxiputmyQ?language=php)|
| Exponentiation (**) | Raise to the power | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/6sE4_Hedyhj9C2Sodr0zkw?language=php) | 

## Assignment Operator
Php assignment operators are used with numerical value to write a value to a variable. 

| Expression | Equivalent | Discription | Demo|
|-------|--------|---------|------------|
| a = b | a = b | The value on the left hand side get assigned to the value on the right hand side | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/P0QA1PjfS4XHTO3029iKfQ)|
| a += b | a = a + b | Addition | [DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/LtzUkOolrr5NkC_mk88XFg?language=php) |
|a-=b| a = a - b | Subtraction |[DEMO](https://paiza.io/projects/mqJYHZBMzxyBSTXtY23Hvw?language=php)|

The multiplication, division and modulus will go on in the same way.

## Comparision Operators

| Operator | Discription | Demo|
|-------|--------|---------|
| == | True if two variables are equal | [DEMO]() |
| === | True if two variables are identical i.e. both value and datatype | [DEMO]() |
| != | True if two variables are not equal | [DEMO]() |
| <> | True if are not equal | [DEMO]() |
| !== | True if two variables are not identical | [DEMO]() |
| > | Greater than | [DEMO]() |
| < | Less than | [DEMO]() |
| >= | Greater or equal to | [DEMO]() |
| <= | Less than or equal to | [DEMO]() |
