## Scripting Language
- Scripting language, is a language that does not require compilation and is interpreted one line at a time.
- Scripting language can be classified into two types
1. Client side scripting language 
2. Server side scripting language

## Client side scripting language
- Does not need to interact with the web server 
- Runs on userâ€™s computer
- Reduces load on server

## Server side scripting language
- Requires interaction with servers (eg apache and nginx)
- Runs on the web server
- Increases the processing load on server to create a dynamic website
